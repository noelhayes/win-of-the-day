# Components Directory

This directory contains all React components used throughout the application. The components are organized into subdirectories based on their functionality and purpose.

## Barrel File (index.js)

The `index.js` file at the root of the components directory serves as a barrel file. This pattern provides several benefits:

1. **Simplified Imports**: Instead of importing components with their full paths, you can import them directly from the components directory:
   ```javascript
   // Instead of:
   import ProfileHeader from '../../../components/profile/ProfileHeader';
   import GoalsList from '../../../components/profile/GoalsList';
   
   // You can do:
   import { ProfileHeader, GoalsList } from '../../../components';
   ```

2. **Centralized Exports**: All component exports are managed in one place, making it easier to:
   - Track available components
   - Manage component dependencies
   - Refactor component locations without updating every import

3. **Encapsulation**: The internal directory structure can be changed without affecting external imports

## Directory Organization

- **common/**: Higher-level, application-specific components that are reused across features
- **post/**: Components related to post creation, editing, and display
- **profile/**: Components for user profiles and related functionality
- **dashboard/**: Components specific to the productivity dashboard
- **feed/**: Components related to the main feed functionality
- **ui/**: Lower-level, generic UI components that could potentially be used in any app

## Best Practices

1. Always import components through the barrel file when using them outside the components directory
2. Keep component files focused and single-responsibility
3. Place new components in the most appropriate subdirectory based on their functionality
4. Update the barrel file when adding new components
5. Consider creating new subdirectories if a new category of components emerges
